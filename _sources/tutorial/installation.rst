Installation
============

Currently, there are two ways to install the package.

#. ``pydropsonde`` is available via `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pydropsonde/>`_ such that you can directly install the package with ``pip``

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install pydropsonde


#. Alternatively, you can clone the repository by

   .. code-block:: bash

           git clone git@github.com:atmdrops/pydropsonde.git


   and create a respective python environment with ``conda`` from the base folder directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda env create -f environment.yaml

   This will install ``pydropsonde`` in development mode.
