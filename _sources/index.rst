pydropsonde
===========

``pydropsonde`` is a python package for processing atmospheric profile measurements from dropsondes.
It is based on the software part in `halodrops <https://github.com/Geet-George/halodrops>`_.

Dropsondes are small measurement devices that when dropped from high altitudes will measure a vertical profile of temperature, pressure, relative humidity and winds in the atmosphere.
The profile data needs to run through several quality control steps and can be further processed to userfriendly dataset potentially including derived data.
Individual processing steps and the resulting data levels available from `pydropsonde` are described in increasing detail in the below subsections.
